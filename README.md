Explanation :

So my first hour was pretty much smoove sailing, I created my POJO and made sure they had annotations and created classes
for them. I set up my retrofit interface and created my call in my main method. I got alittle confused about the thired step 
but found out that I needed to use a JSON object as opposed to a Retro fit call. So I deleted my call and interface and 
attempted to create my JSON object. Hour two was about recovering from the mistake of using Retro fit , I worked on my JSON 
object for about half hour and learned that we could use retrofit. 

I recreated my call and my biggest roadblock was my Log statements. I completed the first three steps but couldn't see any
log statements but because of time and my app not crashing I kept going. When it got time to set the data to my textview
I wasnt receiving anything. I spent the remaining time trying to see log statements.
